            Working with students from High School to University age to build the foundations of their careers and ensuring a community oriented 
                mindset in their growth.

        <p>
            Through the use of seminars, activities, reading programs, and camps, I continue to teach and educate the youth on how to be 
            better members of the community and how to give back to the world. I am dedicated to ensuring a smooth transition between High School and University, and further
            into their lives.

            Assessed the complex needs of my community, leading me tackle a distinct issue: the lack of English and Cultural education for refugee
            students from my community residing in the country of Norway. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Through the use of curriculums I made, I was able to teach these students the English language while maintaining their Cultural
             background and identity. I also acted as their mentor in daily interactions.
